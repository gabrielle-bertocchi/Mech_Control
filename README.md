üõ†Ô∏è MechControl: Workshop Management App
This is the MechControl project. It is a web application made to help manage car workshops better. This app was built as part of the school's 

Work-Related Learning (WRL100) module.

The full program code, including all pages and files, is here on GitHub. This makes the project easy for other people to see and check.

üíª Technologies Used (The Tools)
The MechControl app uses three main tools to work:

Python Flask (Backend): This is the main part of the program. We chose Flask because it is small and flexible for building applications quickly. It handles the security (login), user roles, and talks to the database.

MySQL (Database): This tool is used to store all the information. It keeps safe records for users, vehicles, and parts requests.

Tailwind CSS and HTML (Frontend): HTML makes the web pages. Tailwind CSS makes the website look good and ensures it works well on mobile phones and other devices.


üöÄ Key Features (What the App Can Do)
The main things the MechControl application can do are:


User Login: Different people (like Mechanics, Parts Staff, or Managers) can log in with different roles.


Vehicle Tracking: You can add new vehicles and search for them using their number plate. You can also see the history of previous checks.


Add Diagnostics: A Mechanic can easily write notes about a vehicle's problem. They can also upload photos or videos to these notes.


Parts Requests: Users can ask for parts needed for a vehicle (e.g., the part name and how many are needed).


Parts Inbox: This page lets users see and filter all the requests. Managers and Parts Staff can update the status of these requests.


Dashboard: A simple page that shows general numbers, like the total number of vehicles.

‚û°Ô∏è How to Run the App (Next Steps)
Get the Code: Take the code from this GitHub page.

Use Python: Run the main file (app.py) to start the web program.

Use MySQL: The program will connect to your MySQL database to save the data.
